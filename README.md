# SNN-Framework-
## Simple framework for Spiking Neural Network (CNS Course project)
This project is a framework for SNN for computational neuroscience course project, Department of Computer Science, University of Tehran. The framework is capable of simulating different neural models and population to be used as convolutional and pooling layers. It can also encode the input or apply filters by using different types of encoding methods such as Gabor, DoG, Latency to Intensity and etc.
